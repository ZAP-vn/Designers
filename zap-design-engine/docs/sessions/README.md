# Session Logs

This directory contains session logs for development work on the ZAP Design Engine.

## Purpose

Session logs serve as check-in records that:

- Track progress during development sessions
- Link work to unique task IDs
- Provide commit message templates
- Document what was accomplished and why
- Help with git history and future reference

## Naming Convention

```
SESSION-TASK-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
```

Example: `SESSION-TASK-20260203-164805.md`

## What to Include

Each session log should contain:

- **Task ID** - Unique identifier for the session
- **Date/Time** - When the work was done
- **Objective** - What you were trying to accomplish
- **Summary** - What was completed
- **Files Modified** - List of changed files
- **Technical Details** - Important implementation notes
- **Suggested Commit Message** - Template for git commit

## Workflow

1. Complete development work
2. Run "Summarize our progress and current constraints so far"
3. Generate session log file
4. Review and adjust as needed
5. Use suggested commit message for git commit
6. Commit session log file along with your changes

## Future: Master File Sync

*(To be discussed: How local session files sync with master tracking file)*
